Title EXAMPLE 6.7. Simulate the analytical measurement of exchangeable cations
# Place 5 g (dry) soil in a centrifuge tube and extract twice with 20 mL 1 M NaCl. We neglect the contribution from
# the original pore water, but do consider that 2.5 mL of the extractant remains in the centrifuge tube after decanting.
# As a result, in the 2nd extraction a fraction 2.5 / 20 â€€ 0.125 of the first extraction is added to the second one.
